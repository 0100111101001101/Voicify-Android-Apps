# Types:  Allow you to configure the Assistant NLU (natural language understanding) to extract structured data from user input.
# Types are configured as key-value pairs of information, where the key is the name of the type and the values are synonyms for that key. 
# When you define the key, it is automatically added as a value. With the Actions SDK, you represent keys as entities, and values as synonyms.
