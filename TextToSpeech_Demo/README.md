**Simple Text-to-Speech Demonstration application**
This application is simply a proof of concept to determine if Text to speech implementation is feasible for future integration into voicifying android apps.

It utilises Google's TextToSpeech api to enable text to speech functionality within android applications.
The demo consists of a master toggle switch to control status of the TTS feature, along with a EditText field for users to input text which can then be spoken using the "Speak" button.

Additionally, some test statements were added to the readMessage method, in order to test the stringReader method which can accept any string and convert it to voice.

**Requirements:**
- Android Version 1.6+
- API Level 4
